Welcome to ML for ML Systems, taught by Prof. [Luis Ceze](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/luisceze) ![A portrait of Luis](pikachu.jpg) with [Zihao Ye](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~zhye/) as TA.

ML models are quickly become an integral component of how applications are built. Yet they are a different thing than most software — performance hungry, bandwidth hungry, and very fast-evolving. This lead to the need to build systems to support them — abstractions and frameworks to tame complexity and quickly adapt, compilers, programming languages and runtime systems to make efficient use of hardware resources, better communication approaches for distributed systems, etc. One important twist to this fast systems development is that optimization spaces for ML systems themselves (codegen fo ML models, systems parameter tuning, resource allocation, etc) are very large, so these systems use machine learning itself to provide effective solutions — so you read the name of the class right, it is “ML for ML systems” ;).

In this special topics class we will explore the state-of-the-art and research on ML systems, including: ML model compilers, ML training systems, ML serving systems, support for large language models serving, ML systems that span cloud and edge, resource management for ML, among others. The format is a participatory focused on paper reading, presenting and discussion, and a class project scoped and chosen by the participants.

This website will be updated throughout the quarter, so check back for the latest.
